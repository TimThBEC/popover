This is a temporary site for troubleshooting an interaction between Shadcn and Radix Popover components with GSAP ScrollSmoother.

The expected behavior is that the popover would open without affecting the scroll position of its parent section. However, both the Radix and the Shadcn popovers are causing the parent section to scroll up when their triggers are below the fold.

There are three pages to this site, two showing the unexpcted behaviors of Radix and Shadcn with ScrollSmoother, and one showing the expected behavior of Shadcn without ScrollSmoother.
